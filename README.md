# chatbot
Simple OpenAI chatbot

I. Purpose

The goal of this application is to implement the basics of AI-integration by building a simple, light-weight chatbot. The scope of this should
go no further than acting as a Chat-GPT clone. This project is for learning the basics of hooking an API key up to a server, communicating directly
with the LLM via the key, and building the frontend components necessary to allow an end-user to interact with the LLM through the application.

II. Tools and technologies

The plan is for this to be a React-Express app. React frontend, Express server, OpenAI API key.

Other node packages used include:
1. cors: allows the frontend (React) to call the API key
2. dotenv: loads the .env file, allowing me to protect keys and other dark secrets
